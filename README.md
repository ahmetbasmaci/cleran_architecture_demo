>The base folder structure for implementing the Clean Architecture pattern in Flutter and Dart typically involves organizing code into layers of responsibility. This includes the Presentation layer for UI and event handling, the Domain layer for business logic, and the Data layer for data handling. Each layer has its own set of folders and files that help in maintaining a clean separation of concerns, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable. For real-world projects, this structure can greatly facilitate scalability and collaborative development efforts.
